# Stage 3 Experiment Workbench Refactor Summary

## Overview
This commit represents a major refactor of Stage 3 (Model Training & Evaluation) with modernized UI components and improved data source configuration system. The changes focus on replacing legacy dropdown selectors with multi-select building/floor systems and updating the underlying data structures.

## Key Changes

### 1. UI Component Modernization
- **DataSourceConfigurationPanel.tsx**: Complete redesign of Test Set Source and Unlabeled Source configuration
  - Replaced dropdown selectors with multi-select building/floor checkbox system
  - Implemented TimeRangeFilter-style UI with grid-based layout
  - Added indeterminate state support for building checkboxes
  - Improved user experience for selecting multiple buildings and specific floors

### 2. Data Structure Improvements
- **DataSource Interface Cleanup**: Removed obsolete properties from experiment/types.ts
  - Removed: `building: string` and `floors: string[]`
  - Retained: `selectedFloorsByBuilding: Record<string, string[]>` and `timeRange`
  - Updated all consuming components to use the new structure

### 3. API Configuration Updates
- **experiment/api.ts**: Updated default configurations to use new data structure
  - Modified `getDefaultConfig()` to return `selectedFloorsByBuilding` format
  - Updated all experiment scenarios (ERM_BASELINE, GENERALIZATION_CHALLENGE, DOMAIN_ADAPTATION)

### 4. Component Architecture Refactor
- **Stage3ExperimentWorkbench.tsx**: Comprehensive updates to main workbench
  - Fixed compilation errors from interface changes
  - Updated experiment configuration building logic
  - Improved validation logic for new data structure
  - Enhanced experiment payload construction for API compatibility

### 5. Type Safety Improvements
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Consistent type usage across all experiment-related components
- Improved type definitions for better development experience

## Technical Impact

### Breaking Changes
- `DataSource` interface no longer supports `building` and `floors` properties
- All experiment configurations now use `selectedFloorsByBuilding` structure
- API payloads updated to match new data format

### Compatibility
- Backward compatibility maintained through data transformation logic
- Legacy experiment configurations automatically converted to new format
- Database schema remains unchanged (only frontend changes)

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced redundant data structures
- More efficient building/floor selection logic
- Streamlined validation processes

## Files Modified

### Core Components
- `apps/pu/src/app/case-study/components/experiment/DataSourceConfigurationPanel.tsx`
- `apps/pu/src/app/case-study/components/Stage3ExperimentWorkbench.tsx`
- `apps/pu/src/app/case-study/components/experiment/ExperimentResultsPanel.tsx`

### Type Definitions & API
- `apps/pu/src/app/case-study/components/experiment/types.ts`
- `apps/pu/src/app/case-study/components/experiment/api.ts`

### Infrastructure
- `packages/database/prisma/zod/index.ts` (Auto-generated type updates)

## Testing Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ All experiment scenarios (ERM, Generalization, Domain Adaptation) validated
- ✅ UI components render correctly with new multi-select system
- ✅ Data transformation logic working as expected

## Next Steps
1. User acceptance testing for new UI experience
2. Integration testing with backend API endpoints
3. Performance monitoring for large building/floor datasets
4. Documentation updates for new configuration format

## Migration Notes
For developers working with experiment configurations:
- Replace `dataSource.building` with `Object.keys(dataSource.selectedFloorsByBuilding)[0]`
- Replace `dataSource.floors` with `Object.values(dataSource.selectedFloorsByBuilding).flat()`
- Use new validation logic: `Object.keys(selectedFloorsByBuilding).length > 0 && Object.values(selectedFloorsByBuilding).some(floors => floors.length > 0)`

This refactor significantly improves the user experience for Stage 3 experiment configuration while maintaining system reliability and type safety.
